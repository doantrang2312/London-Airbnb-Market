# London-Airbnb-Market : Despite the high competition, how prospective hosts can identify new opportunities and maximise their listings potential?

## Description
This is a data analysis project of the London Airbnb market, targeting prospective hosts who are interested in starting their own hosting business on the platform. 

The main objective of the project is to provide insights into the market, such as the density of Airbnb listings by neighbourhood, the host profile (investor or individual), and the types of rooms available for rent etc. 

Using this information, I analyzed the supply and demand curve to identify neighbourhoods with relatively high demand, which could be suitable locations for prospective hosts to start their business. 

Additionally, I provided recommendations on the right pricing policy and how to take care of the listing on the website to maximize its potential. 

By doing so, the prospective hosts can make informed decisions about their investment in the London Airbnb market and increase their chances of success. The project also highlights the potential of data analysis in gaining insights into the market and making informed decisions about business investments.
